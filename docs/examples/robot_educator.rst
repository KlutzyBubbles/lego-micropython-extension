Robot Educator
=====================

This example makes the Robot Educator (:numref:`fig_robot_educator`) drive until it sees an obstacle. It then backs up, turns around, and starts driving again.

You can find building instructions for the Robot Educator on the `LEGO Education website <https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/building-instructions#robot>`_.
