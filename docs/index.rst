Getting started with EV3 MicroPython
====================================

This guide shows you how to get started writing MicroPython programs for your
LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 robots. You'll learn to do so in two steps:

- :doc:`Installation <startinstall>`: First you'll prepare your computer and
    your EV3 Brick by collecting and installing the required tools. You'll also
    learn how to turn the EV3 Brick on and off and to navigate the menu on the
    screen.

After you've run the first demo program, you'll be ready to try out the example
programs and start inventing your own programs.
